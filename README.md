# PROYECTOS: y... ¡ya estaría! 💥

For this third module of the bootcamp we had to create a website whose main design was provided to the team by the Product Owner. However, we were given the liberty of adapting it to our own aesthetic and thee opportunity of suggesting to our client a new design. This website was created based on our current knowledge of React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SASS.

The website "PROYECTOS: y... ¡ya estaría!" gives its users the opportunity to present their projects, share information about them and advertise them to a wide audience. This is achieved through the creation of business cards for each project and its authors. The cards is created digitally and can be shared through a link generated automatically by our website.

Our website includes a landing page as well as a main page, where the project cards can be designed and shared.
